1. The project is done using a publicly available dataset. It simulates an approach I had taken while leading a Water Purification Plant
and Carbonated Soft Drink plant to predict the demand for variants that we produced and thereby optimizing production, raw material
requirements as well as pricing for the
product. 
2. The dataset has 2160 products and 4 warehouses so a possibility of 8640 combinations of product x warehouse
and the goal of the project is to forecast the warehouse requirements of inventory at a given time frame. It is attached as a zip file
with the name Historical Product Demand. 
3. The approach to the project can be found in the Project Intitialisation Document (word document)
4. The data for the project can be found in Historical Product Demand (csv document)
5. The code used to run the project can be found in Historical Product Demand V1R4 (a .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file)
6. The reports generated from the code are: 
   - 1 Sample Report for Product Code Product_0001 Warehouse Whse_A...Sequential (a PDF file)
   - Final Metrics(a csv file)
   - Model Performance Summaries(a csv File)
   - Monthly Forecast(a csv file)
